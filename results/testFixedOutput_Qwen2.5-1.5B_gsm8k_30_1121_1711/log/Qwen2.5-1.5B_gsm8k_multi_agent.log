--- Iteration 1 ---
Solver Response:
Janet's two types of consumption are as follows: 
- Breakfasts - Three raw oysters cost a dollar each; therefore they will be worth $\$0.\overline5$. Thus we can say that Janets total expenses on these items amount to $$\frac {7}{8}$$.
The remaining number after subtracting both costs from one another would give us our desired result which equals approximately \$9.

So there you have it!
