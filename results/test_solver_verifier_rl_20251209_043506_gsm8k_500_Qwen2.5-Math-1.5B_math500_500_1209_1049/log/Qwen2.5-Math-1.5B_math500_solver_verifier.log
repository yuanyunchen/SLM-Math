Solver Response:
To convert the point \((0, 3)\) from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the radius \(r\) and the angle \(\theta\).

The formulas to convert from rectangular coordinates \((x, y)\) to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\) are:
\[ r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]
\[ \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \]

However, we need to be careful with the \(\arctan\) function because it does not distinguish between the different quadrants. For the point \((0, 3)\), \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\), so we need to handle this case separately.

1. Calculate \(r\):
\[ r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \]

2. Calculate \(\theta\):
Since \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\), the point lies on the positive y-axis. The angle \(\theta\) for this point is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).

So the polar coordinates are \((3, \frac{\pi}{2})\).

Let's confirm this with Python code.
```python
import math

# Rectangular coordinates
x = 0
y = 3

# Calculate r
r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)

# Calculate theta
# Since x is 0, we need to handle the case separately
if x == 0:
    if y > 0:
        theta = math.pi / 2
    elif y < 0:
        theta = 3 * math.pi / 2
    else:
        theta = 0  # or theta = math.pi, depending on convention
else:
    theta = math.atan2(y, x)

# Ensure theta is in the range [0, 2*pi)
if theta < 0:
    theta += 2 * math.pi

print(((r, theta)))
```
```output
(3.0, 1.5707963267948966)
```
The polar coordinates for the point \((0, 3)\) are \((3, \frac{\pi}{2})\).

So the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}

Solver Response:
To solve the problem, we need to express the double sum \(\sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\) in terms of \(p\) and \(q\), where \(p = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}\) and \(q = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}\).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Rewrite the Double Sum:**
   The double sum \(\sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\) can be rewritten by changing the order of summation. We can sum over all pairs \((j, k)\) such that \(j + k = n\), where \(n\) ranges from 2 to \(\infty\). For each \(n\), there are \(n-1\) pairs \((j, k)\) such that \(j + k = n\). Therefore, we can rewrite the double sum as:
   \[
   \sum_{n=2}^\infty \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{n^3} = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n-1}{n^3} = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \left(\frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3}\right).
   \]

2. **Separate the Summation:**
   We can separate the summation into two parts:
   \[
   \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}.
   \]
   Notice that the first sum starts from \(n=2\) and the second sum also starts from \(n=2\). We can express these sums in terms of \(p\) and \(q\):
   \[
   \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = p - 1,
   \]
   \[
   \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = q - 1.
   \]
   Therefore, the double sum becomes:
   \[
   (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.
   \]

So, the final answer is \(\boxed{p - q}\

So, the final answer is:
