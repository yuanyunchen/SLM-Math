Solver Response:
To determine how much Janet makes each day from selling the remaining eggs after accounting for those eaten by herself and used to bake muffins, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats for breakfast and uses to bake muffins.
3. Determine the number of eggs left over that are sold.
4. Calculate the revenue generated from selling these leftover eggs.

Let's go through this step-by-step using Python code to ensure accuracy.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Total Eggs Laid Per Day**: 
   - Given: 16 eggs/day
2. **Eggs Eaten for Breakfast**:
   - Given: 3 eggs/breakfast
3. **Muffin Baking**:
   - Given: 4 eggs/muffin (assuming one muffin is made from 4 eggs)
4. **Revenue Calculation**:
   - Each egg sold generates $2 profit.

We'll now implement this logic in Python to find out how much money Janet makes each day.
```python
# Constants
eggs_per_day = 16
breakfast_eggs = 3
muffin_bake_eggs = 4
price_per_egg = 2

# Total eggs consumed or baked
total_consumed_or_baked = breakfast_eggs + muffin_bake_eggs

# Remaining eggs available for sale
remaining_eggs_for_sale = eggs_per_day - total_consumed_or_baked

# Revenue calculation
revenue_per_day = remaining_eggs_for_sale * price_per_egg
print(revenue_per_day)
```
```output
10
```
After performing the calculations, we find that Janet makes \(\boxed{10}\

Solver Response:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid each day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats for breakfast (3) from the total number of eggs.
3. Subtract the number of eggs Janet uses to bake muffins (4) from the remaining eggs.
4. Determine how many eggs are left after accounting for both consumption and baking.
5. Since each egg is sold for $2, multiply the number of remaining eggs by $2 to get the total earnings.

Let's break it down into code:
```python
# Step-by-step calculation

# Total number of eggs laid per day
total_eggs = 16

# Eggs eaten for breakfast
eggs_eaten_for_breakfast = 3

# Eggs used for baking muffins
eggs_used_for_baking = 4

# Remaining eggs after consumption and baking
remaining_eggs = total_eggs - (eggs_eaten_for_breakfast + eggs_used_for_baking)

# Price per egg
price_per_egg = 2

# Total earnings
earnings = remaining_eggs * price_per_egg
print(earnings)
```
```output
10

Solver Response:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of bolts required for both the blue and white fibers combined.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. It also requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber.

Let's break down the steps:

1. Calculate the amount of white fiber needed:
   - White fiber = \( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{blue fiber} \)

2. Sum up the total number of bolts required (both blue and white).

We'll use Python code to ensure our calculations are accurate.
```python
# Given data
blue_fiber_bolts = 2

# Calculating the white fiber requirement
white_fiber_bolts = blue_fiber_bolts / 2

# Total bolts calculation
total_bolts = blue_fiber_bolts + white_fiber_bolts

Solver Response:
To solve this problem, let's break down the requirements:

1. A robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. It also requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber.

Let's calculate how many bolts of white fiber are needed:
\[ \text{White Fiber} = \frac{\text{Blue Fiber}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]

Now we can find out the total number of bolts required for both colors combined:
\[ \text{Total Bolts} = \text{Blue Fiber} + \text{White Fiber} = 2 + 1 = 3 \]

We'll use Python to verify these calculations.
```python
# Define the amount of blue fibers used
blue_fiber_bolts = 2

# Calculate the amount of white fibers used (half the amount of blue fibers)
white_fiber_bolts = blue_fiber_bolts / 2

# Calculate the total number of bolts required
total_bolts = blue_fiber_bolts + white_fiber_bolts
print(total_bolts)
```
